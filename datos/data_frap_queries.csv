Here, <i>Ganoderma</i> isolates were assessed for the treatment of rum stillage while producing biomass and associated metabolites. Isolates grew in 25% raw stillage, removing up to 73% of soluble organic carbon, 77% soluble nitrogen, and 74% phenolic compounds. Isolate G2 demonstrated faster removal of organic carbon and nitrogen. Biomass and metabolite production were benchmarked against a nutrient medium. In stillage, maximum values of the following were obtained: 8.2 g·L<sup>-1</sup> biomass; 52.8% crude protein; 22.1 mg·g<sup>-1</sup> extractable protein; antioxidants of 17.2 mg TE·g<sup>-1</sup> (2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), ABTS) and 16.6 µmol Fe<sup>2+</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup> (ferric reducing antioxidant power, FRAP); 2.9 mg GAE·g<sup>-1</sup> phenolic compounds (gallic acid equivalents); 1.2% lipids; and 11% β-glucans. In the nutrient medium, the following were obtained: 6.9 g·L<sup>-1</sup> biomass; 56.4% crude protein; 38.7 mg·g<sup>-1</sup> extractable protein; antioxidants of 24.9 mg TE·g<sup>-1</sup> (ABTS) and 25.9 µmol Fe<sup>2+</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup> (FRAP); 6.0 mg GAE·g<sup>-1</sup> phenolic compounds; 0.7% lipids; and 13% β-glucans. To our knowledge, this is the first report detailing the biomass metabolite content of <i>Ganoderma</i> mycelium using rum stillage.

It can be hydrolyzed into glucose units via specific enzymes called cellulases that have been applied in many commercial fields. There are several studies illustrate the influence of enzymes on apple juice clarification. However, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of microbial cellulase on volatile compounds of apple juice is not well known. The present study aimed to assess the effect of cellulase from a new bacterial isolate on the physicochemical properties of apple juice as well as volatile compounds. The hydrolysis of some polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin) and polyphenols during apple juice production is necessary to reduce cloud sedimentation or color deterioration and increase the yield of juice. So, enzymes from new microbial isolates serve as processing aids to obtain clear juice with a high yield. Cellulase-producing bacterium was isolated, characterized and molecularly identified as Bacillus licheniformis strain-MA1 with an accession number of ON840115. Optimization of medium parameters was implemented using Plackett-Burman design (PBd) followed by Box-Behnken design (BBd) of response surface methodology (RSM). The PBd revealed the three most important (significant) variables including carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), corn cob, and peptone that had positive impact on cellulase production. Additionally, using the agricultural residue (corn cob) by the bacterial strain as a carbon source helps in reducing the costs of enzyme production, recycling the by-products, and preserving the environment. The optimized medium using PBd and BBd enhanced cellulase production from B. licheniformis strain-MA1 by 6.8-fold. A remarkable increase was observed in juice yield in enzyme treated-juice sample (88.2 ± 0.15%) in comparison with control juice (75.4 ± 0.09%). The total phenolic contents in cloudy and clarified apple juices were 0.957 ± 0.09 and 0.412 ± 0.03 mg/mL, respectively. Also, DPPH and FRAP assays showed a remarkable increase in antioxidant activity (Low IC<sub>50</sub>) in the control sample compared to enzyme treatment. Twenty-seven volatile compounds were extracted using headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas and analysis was performed by GC-MS. The identified volatile constituents belonged to several chemical classes: 15 esters; 6 alcohols; 4 aldehydes and 2 acids. The predominant class in apple juice volatile fraction was esters with a sweet and fruity odor. The crude cellulase obtained from the novel bacterial isolate B. licheniformis strain-MA1 was successfully applied as a clarifying agent in apple juice.",residue,apple,0.03,mg/g,

Previous studies have shown that the araticum peel is rich in phenolic compounds; however, little is known about the ideal conditions for recovering these compounds. Therefore, response surface methodology, using a central composite rotatable design, was employed to optimize the extraction process to maximize the total phenolic compounds (TPCs) and enhance the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) from araticum peel. The variables optimized were ethanol concentration (EC; 20-80%, <i>v/v</i>), extraction time (ET; 5-45 min), and solid-solvent ratio (SSR; 10-100 mg/mL). Additionally, condensed tannins, antioxidant capacity against synthetic free radicals (TEAC and FRAP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the phenolic compounds profile, were evaluated. Optimum extraction conditions were 50% (<i>v/v</i>) ethanol concentration, 5 min of extraction time, and 10 mg/mL solid-solvent ratio. Under these conditions, experimental TPCs and TEAC values were 70.16 mg GAE/g dw and 667.22 µmol TE/g dw, respectively, comparable with predicted models (68.47 mg GAE/g dw for TPCs and 677.04 µmol TE/g dw for TEAC). A high condensed tannins content (76.49 mg CE/g dw) was also observed and 12 phenolic compounds were identified, predominantly flavonoids (97.77%), including procyanidin B2, epicatechin, and catechin as the major compounds. Moreover, a potent antioxidant activity was observed against synthetic free radicals and ROS, especially in scavenging peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals. From this study, we obtained the ideal conditions for recovering phenolic compounds from araticum peel using a simple, fast, sustainable, and effective method, offering a promising opportunity for the management of this plant byproduct.",peel,,667.22,µmol te/g,

Pear pomace flour was fractionated into different particle sizes, namely 1 mm, 710 µm, 180 µm, 75 µm and 53 µm. Then two extraction methods, namely maceration with methanol and two-step extraction with hexane via Soxhlet followed by ultrasound extraction with methanol, were tested. Total phenolic and total flavonoid contents ranged from 375.0 to 512.9 mg gallic acid/100 g DW and from 24.7 to 34.6 mg quercetin/100 g DW, respectively. Two-step extraction provided antioxidant activity up to 418.8 (in FRAP assay) and 340.0 mg Trolox/100 g DW (in DPPH assay). In order to explore various bioactive properties, this study assessed the inhibitory effects of enzymes, specifically α-amylase and β-glucosidase (associated with antidiabetic effects), as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (linked to potential antihypertensive benefits). Additionally, the research investigated antibacterial potential against both Gram-negative (<i>E. coli</i>) and Gram-positive (<i>S. aureus</i>) bacteria, revealing significant results (<i>p</i> < 0.05), particularly in the case of the two-step extraction method. This investigation underscores the substantial value of certain food industry wastes, highlighting their potential as bioactive ingredients within the framework of a circular economy.",pomace,pear,340.0,mg Trolox/100g DW,

However, onion leaves have received limited attention despite their potential as a valuable source of nutraceutical compounds. This study aimed to valorise, for the first time, the agricultural waste in the form of spring onion leaves (CN, Cipollotto Nocerino) to obtain antioxidant-rich polyphenolic extracts. A Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used to assess the impact of microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) variables (temperature, time, extraction volume, and ethanol concentration) on total polyphenol content (TPC) measured by Folin-Ciocalteu method and the antioxidant power determined by FRAP assay. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied, and regression equations, analysis of variance, and 3D response curves were developed. Our results highlighted that the TPC values range from 0.76 to 1.43 mg GAE g<sup>-1</sup> dw, while the FRAP values range from 8.25 to 14.80 mmol Fe(II)E g<sup>-1</sup> dw. The optimal extraction conditions predicted by the model were 60 °C, 22 min, ethanol concentration 51% (v/v), and solvent volume 11 mL. These conditions resulted in TPC and FRAP values of 1.35 mg GAE g<sup>-1</sup> dw and 14.02 mmol Fe(II)E g<sup>-1</sup> dw, respectively. Furthermore, the extract obtained under optimized conditions was characterized by UHPLC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS analysis. LC/MS-MS platform allowed us to tentatively identify various compounds belonging to the class of flavonoids, saponins, fatty acids, and lipids. Finally, the ability of CN optimal extract to inhibit the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) release in a hepatocarcinoma cell line using an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress model, was evaluated. The results highlighted the potential of CN extract as a valuable source of polyphenols with significant antioxidant properties, suitable for various applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries.",peel,,1.35,mg,

From fresh and freeze-dried prawn and shrimp shells, protein hydrolysates (carotenoproteins) were obtained using two different enzymes, Flavourzyme and Protamex. The obtained hydrolysates were characterised in terms of protein content, degree of hydrolysis, and antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. The hydrolysate with the best antioxidant properties (FRAP value of 2933.33 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> TE; ORAC value of 115.58 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> TE) was selected and tested for its possible use as a component of functional foods. Molecular weight distribution, amino acid profile and free amino acids, the solubility of the hydrolysate in different pH ranges as well as foaming ability were determined. It was found that this hydrolysate was characterised by an amino acid profile with high nutritional value, flavour enhancement properties and excellent solubility in a wide pH range (from 97.06% to 100%). Afterward, the possibility of using carotenoproteins from prawn waste as a component of an emulsion with furcellaran and a lipid preparation of astaxanthin, taken from post-hydrolysate production waste, was investigated. The obtained complexes were stable as proved by the measurement of zeta potential (ζ = -23.87 and -22.32 to -27.79 mV). It is possible to produce stable complexes of the hydrolysate with furcellaran and to emulsify a lipid preparation of astaxanthin, obtained from waste following production of the hydrolysate, in them. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",shell,,2933.33,μmol,

Osbeck is underutilised citrus crop that receives little attention due to the lack of knowledge regarding its nutritional value. Citrus waste disposal poses a problem due to economic and environmental factors. The metabolites flavonoids, phenols and antioxidant capacity in the dropped fruits of the underutilised citrus species pomelo (<i>Citrus grandis</i> (L.) Osbeck) were examined. Hesperidin varied from 1.22 to 2.83% and 1.08 to 1.16% from 10 mm to 14 mm whereas naringin dominates in fruits measuring 10 mm and 12mm with 60.61%, 60.77%, and 47.76%, 45.87% in freeze dried (FD) and hot air oven dried (HAOD) samples. According to the results of the antioxidant assays, the highest concentrations of ABTS azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical) were found in freeze dried samples, ranging from 9.679 to 10.416 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> Trolox and 14.825 to 16.432 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> Trolox, respectively. However, the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) assay revealed higher content in samples of both FD and HAOD that were 10mm in size (4.578 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> Trolox and 3.730 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> Trolox). Total phenol content was measured, and the highest concentrations were found in fruits with a diameter between 10 mm and 18 mm. It ranged from 48.479 to 54.498 mg GAE L<sup>-1</sup> in FD samples and from 45.757 to 51.159 mg GAE L<sup>-1</sup> in HAOD samples. The smallest fruits, or those that were still in the immature stage, had the highest content. It was found that when the immature dropped fruits were dried by HAOD, the content decreased. At p<0.01 and p<0.05, there was a significant positive correlation between the flavonoids, antioxidants, and total phenols. The results showed that the immature dropped immature fruits of lesser known underutilised citrus sp. <i>Citrus grandis</i> can act as potential source of flavonoids, total phenol concentration, and antioxidant potential. Freeze drying can be recommended to recover the most bioactive substances from physiologically dropped fruits of <i>Citrus grandis</i> for use in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical sectors.

However, a huge amount of stone fruits waste is produced throughout the food supply chain during picking, handling, processing, packaging, storage, transportation, retailing and final consumption. These stone fruits waste contain high phenolic content which are the main contributors to the antioxidant potential and associated health benefits. The antioxidant results showed that plum waste contained higher concentrations of total phenolic content (TPC) (0.94 ± 0.07 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g) and total flavonoid content (TFC) (0.34 ± 0.01 mg quercetin equivalents (QE)/g), while apricot waste contained a higher concentration of total tannin content (TTC) (0.19 ± 0.03 mg catechin equivalents (CE)/g) and DPPH activity (1.47 ± 0.12 mg ascorbic acid equivalents (AAE)/g).

Carob pulp, with its high intrinsic sucrose content and high levels of polyphenols, shows great potential to be transformed into a prebiotic food. In this study, we investigated the development of a functional food product based on carob pulp, with an emphasis on sustainability. The intrinsic sucrose content of the carob pulp extracts was in situ converted into the prebiotic FOS using two approaches: 1) commercial enzyme complexes, specifically, Viscozyme® L, Pectinex® Ultra SP-L, Catazyme® 25 L, and Novozym® 960; or 2) fermentation with microorganisms, namely Aureobasidium pullulans CCY 27.1.94 and Aspergillus ibericus MUM 03.49. Under optimal conditions, 86 ± 1 g/L of sucrose was extracted from carob pulp using a pulp:water ratio of 1:3 (w/v) at 46.1 °C for 132 min. The enzyme blend Novozym® 960 produced the best results yielding 0.423 ± 0.013 g<sub>FOS</sub>/g<sub>initial sucrose</sub>, with a purity of 29.6 ± 0.3 (w/w) after 45 min of reaction.

Enrichment with aguamiel, a low-cost substrate supporting a more sustainable process, resulted in a prebiotic yield of 0.422 ± 0.007 g<sub>FOS</sub>/g<sub>initial sucrose</sub>. The carob pulp extract exhibited significant antioxidant activity, with 72.1 ± 0.2 μmol TEq/g DW by the FRAP assay and 5.35 ± 0.05 μg/mL by ABTS, along with high phenolic (8.57 ± 0.04 mg GAEq/g DW) and flavonoid (2.74 ± 0.02 mg CEq/g DW) contents. The treatment with Novozym® 960 enhanced the release of bioactive compounds, further increasing antioxidant activity. Conversely, fungal fermentation transformed or metabolized these phytochemicals, resulting in reduced antioxidant activity. The produced FOS exhibited notable resistance to the harsh conditions of gastro-intestinal digestion, with less than 10 % undergoing hydrolysis. Carob pulp and aguamiel have shown great promise as alternatives to synthetic media for producing functional foods enriched with prebiotic FOS, phenolic acids, and flavonoids.

The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities, glycemic index, phytic acid, and β-glucan of individual wheat bran hydrolysate (EH-WB), sprouted wheat (SW), oat hull hydrolysate (EH-OH), sprouted oat (SO), and combined ingredients (CI 1, CI 2, and CI3) were used to tailor an optimal nutraceutical formula. The three blend ingredients (CI 1, CI2, and CI3) were formulated at different ratios (EH-WB:SW:EH-OH:SO; 1:1:1:1, 2:1:2:1, and 1:2:1:2, <i>w</i>:<i>w</i>:<i>w</i>:<i>w</i>, respectively). The resulting mixtures showed total phenol (TPs) content ranging from 412.93 to 2556.66 µmol GAE 100 g<sup>-1</sup> and antioxidant capacity values from 808.14 to 22,152.54 µmol TE 100 g<sup>-1</sup> (ORAC) and 1914.05 to 7261.32 µmol TE 100 g<sup>-1</sup> (ABTS<sup>•+</sup>), with Fe<sup>3+</sup> reducing ability from 734. 02 to 8674.51 mmol reduced Fe 100 g<sup>-1</sup> (FRAP) for the individual ingredients produced from EH-WB and EH-OH, where high antioxidant activity was observed. However, the anti-inflammatory results exhibited an interesting behavior, with a potentially synergistic effect of the individual ingredients. This effect was observed in CI2 and CI3, resulting in a higher ability to inhibit IL-6 and TNF-α than expected based on the anti-inflammatory values of their individual ingredients. Similar to the antioxidant properties, oat-based ingredients significantly contributed more to the anti-inflammatory properties of the overall mixture. This contribution is likely associated with the β-glucans and avenanthramides present in oats. To ensure the bioaccessibility of these ingredients, further studies including simulated digestion protocols would be necessary. The ingredient formulated with a 2:1 hydrolysate-to-sprout ratio was the most effective combination, reaching higher biological characteristics.",hull,wheat,8674.51,mmol/g,

The drying processes of jackfruit seeds were performed at 50, 60 and 70 °C in order to choose the optimal temperature for obtaining the flour based on drying time, polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity. The experimental values of the moisture ratio during jackfruit seed drying at different temperatures were obtained using Page's equation to establish the drying time for the required moisture between 5 and 7% in the flour. The temperature of 60 °C was considered adequate for obtaining good flour and for performing its characterization. The chemical composition, total dietary fiber, functional properties and antioxidant capacity were then examined in the flour. The seed flour contains carbohydrates (73.87 g/100 g), dietary fiber (31 g/100 g), protein (14 g/100 g) and lipids (1 g/100 g). The lipid profile showed that the flour contained monounsaturated (4 g/100 g) and polyunsaturated (46 g/100 g) fatty acids.

In this study, unmilled whole bran (coarse treatment) was compared to whole bran milled to medium and fine treatments from the same wheat bran. Antioxidant properties (capacity, ability, power), carotenoids and phenolic compounds (phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins) were measured and compared. The ability of whole bran fractions of differing particle size distributions to inhibit free radicals was assessed using four in vitro models, namely, diphenylpicrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) assay, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and total antioxidant capacity. Significant differences in phytochemical concentrations and antioxidant properties were observed between whole bran fractions of reduced particle size distribution for some assays. The coarse treatment exhibited significantly higher antioxidant properties compared to the fine treatment; except for the ORAC value, in which coarse was significantly lower. For soluble and bound extractions, the coarse treatment was comparatively higher in total antioxidant capacity (426.72 mg ascorbic acid eq./g) and FRAP value (53.04 μmol FeSO4/g) than bran milled to the finer treatment (314.55 ascorbic acid eq./g and 40.84 μmol FeSO4/g, respectively).

Nevertheless, bamboo culms are a suitable source of functional ingredients, such as antioxidant compounds. However, because of the high compactness and tightness in their material structure, obtaining phytochemicals from bamboo culms using conventional organic solvent extraction methods can be inefficient. In this research, we developed a pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) method to recover 19 target phenolic compounds from <i>Bambusa chungii</i> culms. The extracted compounds were determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS). The antioxidant potential of the extracts was evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. We investigated the effects of temperature, extraction time, and the material-to-liquid ratio on PHWE, and these parameters were optimized with a Box-Behnken design experiment and response surface tool. The optimal extraction condition was found at 170 °C, with a 1:30 g/mL material-to-liquid ratio and a 14 min extraction time. Following these optimal parameters, the total yield of target phenolic compounds (TYPC) reached 3.85 mg/g of raw material, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) for the DPPH and ABTS tests were 94.7 mg/L and 21.88 mg/L, respectively.

Proximate composition showed that the dried extracts were composed mainly of crude protein (14.6%-46.7%) and non-fibre carbohydrates (26.4%-53.5%). With the exception of stem amaranth, all the extracts had >40% DPPH radical scavenging ability at 0.5 mg/ml. In contrast metal chelation was lower, except in Indian spinach with ~46%. The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was highest for the kangkong (10.9 mM Fe<sup>3+</sup> reduced), which is similar to the 9.9 mM for butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). All the extracts suppressed linoleic acid oxidation better than BHT within the first 5 days of the incubation period. We conclude that the Indian spinach, kangkong, and okra could be considered as the most promising sources of antioxidant compounds. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Vegetables are commonly consumed as part of a regular diet but the high water and fiber contents usually mean that large quantities are required to provide long-term health benefits. Therefore, in this work, aqueous extracts of nine Bangladesh vegetables were prepared to provide a more concentrated form of nutrients and bioactive compounds. The extracts had strong nutritional value based on the high contents of crude protein, potassium, iron, and non-fibre carbohydrates. The high content of polyphenolic compounds in the extracts can also provide health benefits, which was demonstrated through strong free radical scavenging, metal chelation, ferric iron reduction, and inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation. These vegetable extracts have the potential to be used as sources of bioactive compounds to prevent or treat non-communicable diseases that are associated with high oxidative stress.",,,0.5,mg/g,"""amaranth"" AND FRAP AND antioxidant"

This study aimed to optimize submerged fermentation conditions for green coffee beans to maximize total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity, such as ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), DPPH (2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), and FRAP (the ferric reducing antioxidant power). Additionally, pH, yeast, and lactic acid bacteria counts were monitored. Fermentation was conducted with selective microbial starters, a varying temperature (25-35 °C), incubation time (3-9 days), and coffee weight (5-10 g) using a Box-Behnken design. To enhance bioactive compound infusion, fresh coffee cherries underwent ultrasonic treatment, increasing their porosity and water-holding capacity. Vacuum impregnation was then used to infuse fermented green coffee bean extract into the cherries. The lowest pH coincided with peak yeast growth, while the coffee weight significantly influenced all responses. The incubation time affected most parameters except DPPH activity, and the temperature impacted only ABTS and DPPH activities. Optimal conditions (35 °C; 7.21 days; 10 g) yielded a TPC of 480.25 µmol GAE/100 g with ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP activities of 725.71, 164.15 and 443.60 µmol TE/g, respectively.

The objective of this study was to monitor the biochemical, physical and sensory changes during fermentation of cocoa beans in cocoa bean processing plants in the department of Caquetá, Colombia. During fermentation, the temperature of the mass and the pH of the pulp and beans were monitored at the different cocoa bean processing plants (Sites ASOACASAN ASA, COMICACAO CMI, COMCAP COC). Also, at two points during fermentation (days 4 and 7), physical properties of the bean were determined, such as variables related to bromatological composition, polyphenolic compounds and antioxidant activity as sensory attributes at the different sites. An increase in dough temperature was found, however the pH of the cotyledon decreased during the fermentation process and the fat and moisture content varied with fermentation time. At the site level, total polyphenol content (TPC), total flavonoids (TF), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) contents were statistically different, with COC being different from the other sites. The TPC was higher at the COC site (507 mg gallic acid equivalent GAE/g Cocoa) with respect to the other sites (< 360 mg GAE/g Cocoa). The TF content followed a similar behavior to TPC, with significant differences between sites and differences between fermentation times for ASA. The TF was higher in COC (309.1 mg catechin/g cocoa) with respect to CMI (215.6 mg catechin/g cocoa) and ASA (185.7 mg catechin/g cocoa).

They have definite medical or health benefits which include prevention or delaying the progress of diseases. Indian gooseberry is a very rich source of vitamin C and phenolics, two potent antioxidant compounds. Similarly curcumin in turmeric, piperine in black pepper and gingerol in ginger have proven antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Incidence of covid-19 pandemic has raised awareness among people the importance of maintaining higher levels of immunity. A study was undertaken at Kerala Agricultural University during 2020-21 to develop an herbal functional drink from Indian gooseberry fruit juice incorporated with turmeric and black pepper powders, ginger juice extract and juice of acid lime fruits. The herbal drink formulated with these ingredients was homogenized at an operating pressure of 175 Bar with a speed of 235 SPM and was subsequently pasteurized at 100 <sup>0</sup> C for 10 minutes in glass bottles, followed by storage under refrigerated conditions at 5 ± 2 <sup>0</sup> C for 3 months.

This invasive fish is discarded by fishermen since native people do not consume it, partly due to its appearance, yet it is rich in protein. The aim of this study was to produce hydrolysates from armoured catfish using food-grade proteases (neutrases HT and PF and alcalase PAL) and investigate the processing conditions (pH and temperature) that lead to a high degree of hydrolysis, antioxidant activity, and Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitory activity. No other similar research has been reported on this underutilized fish. The antioxidant activity was measured by three different methods, ABTS, FRAP and ORAC, with relevance to food and biological systems in order to obtain a more comprehensive assessment of the activity. In addition, the main peptide sequences were identified. All enzymes produced hydrolysates with high antioxidant activity. In particular, the protease HT led to the highest antioxidant activity according to the ABTS (174.68 μmol Trolox equivalent/g fish) and FRAP (7.59 mg ascorbic acid equivalent/g fish) methods and almost the same as PAL according to the ORAC method (51.43 μmol Trolox equivalent/g fish). Moreover, maximum activity was obtained at mild pH and temperature (7.5; 50 °C). Interestingly, the ORAC values obtained here were higher than others previously reported for fish hydrolysates and similar to those reported for fruits such as blueberries, apples and oranges. The peptide sequence IEE(E) was present in several peptides in both hydrolysates; this sequence may be partly responsible for the high antioxidant activity, particularly the one based on iron-reducing power.

In fact, avocado seeds are known as interesting sources of bioactive compounds and carbohydrates, so their utilization may reduce the negative effect produced during the industrial manufacture of avocado-related products. In this sense, deep eutectic solvents (DES) are a novel greener alternative than organic solvents to extract bioactive polyphenols and carbohydrates. The study was based on a Box-Behnken experimental design to study the effect of three factors, temperature (40, 50, 60 °C), time (60, 120, 180 min) and water content (10, 30, 50% <i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) on the responses of total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidant capacity (measured as ABTS and FRAP) and xylose content in the extract. The DES Choline chloride:glycerol (1:1) was used as solvent on avocado seed. Under optimal conditions, TPC: 19.71 mg GAE/g, TFC: 33.41 mg RE/g, ABTS: 20.91 mg TE/g, FRAP: 15.59 mg TE/g and xylose: 5.47 g/L were obtained.

The growing demand for more sustainable processes requires the development of new and effective methods for extracting bioactive compounds from industrial waste. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are a new sustainable alternative to toxic organic solvents due to their non-toxicity and biocompatibility. In this study, five selected DESs were applied for the extraction of bioactive phenolic compounds from avocado peels. The extraction efficiency was evaluated by measuring the total phenolics and flavonoids content. The best extraction results were obtained with choline chloride-acetic acid and -lactic acid (92.03 ± 2.11 mg GAE/g DAP in TPC and 186.01 ± 3.27 mg RE/g DAP); however, all tested DESs show better extraction efficiency than ethanol. All the obtained NADES extracts have high antioxidant activity (FRAP: 72.5-121.1 mg TE/g; TAC: 90.0-126.1 mg AAE/g). The synthesized DESs and avocado peels DES extracts had activity against all tested bacteria (<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Streptococcus dysgalactiae</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>), and the extracts prepared with choline chloride-acetic acid and -lactic acid have the highest antibacterial activity against all microorganisms.

None of them was under specialist medical control, including cardiological control. DAI was investigated on the basis of the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) which included 145 food items. DAI was measured using the method by Benzi and expressed as FRAP (the ability to reduce Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup>, measured in mMol/l). The daily intake of fats was estimated using the 24-h nutritional recall. The frequency of fats consumption was estimated with the usage of FFQ. For statistical analysis, χ2 test was used. The mean value of DAI of all studied persons was 34.27 + 11.72 mMol/l. The largest percentage of those studied had FRAP values in the range 25-35 mMol/l. The highest contribution in the total DAI value was found in fruit (36.2%), grains and cereal-based products (23.6%), and beverages (24.0%). The consumption of vegetables was on the fourth position (7.1%). The contribution of the remaining food products was low. The consumption of total fats (about 70g/24h) and saturated fatty acids (14% of energetic value) exceeded the recommendations. The participation of mono-and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diets was not in accordance with recommendations. The most frequently consumed fats were animal fats (sausages, butter) and cakes, but the consumption of vegetable oils, fish, nuts and seeds of oil plants was too low. The majority of elderly people made mistakes in their nutrition. The enrichment in natural antioxidants of the diets of elderly people and the normalization of their fats consumption should become an important element of primary and secondary prophylaxis of cardiovascular diseases.",cake,,35.0,mmol,grains AND FRAP AND antioxidant

The study aims to verify whether the waste can be reused in another process and not destined to its simple destructive disposal. In this perspective, we first carried out an in-depth chemical-physical analysis of the waste together with a biocompatibility evaluation to plan the feasible final choice of waste destination. The liquid and solid waste derived from the processing of wheat extract were analyzed and characterized through ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS). Results highlight that ferulic acid represent the most abundant phenolic compound for solid waste with a content of 89.782 mg/kg and dihydroferulic acid is the predominant for liquid waste (6.24 mg/L).

The control sample was bread without the addition of walnut male flowers. In the tests, the addition of flowers was used in the amounts of 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0% and 2.5% of the weight of the flour used in the control sample. Bread dough was prepared according to the direct method with the use of yeast. The parameters of the baking process of the control bread and of the test bread were calculated. The selected parameters determining the quality of the obtained bread, including the loaf volume, the specific volume, the crumb porosity, the crumb texture and the color were measured. The antioxidant potential and total polyphenol content were tested both in the dough and in the bread. The test results were analyzed statistically. It was found that the partial replacement of wheat flour with walnut male flowers resulted in a significant reduction in the loaves' volume and in the darkening of both the color of the dough and the crumb. The value of the L* parameter decreased with the increasing addition of walnut flowers. The lowest values of this parameter were found to be 53.87 (crust) and 39.94 (crumb) in the sample with 2.5% addition. The average volume of the loaves ranged from 565 cm<sup>3</sup> (0.5%) to 675 cm<sup>3</sup> (control).

Melanoidins contents continuously increased from 24.1 mg/g to 71.9 mg/g during baking, but their molecular weight decreased at the beginning of the process and increased thereafter. Enrichment of white wheat bread with guava flour increased the incorporation of phenolic compounds up to 2.4-fold. Most phenolic compounds showed higher incorporation than release rates during baking, leading to increases from 3.3- to 13.3-fold in total melanoidin-bound phenolics. Incorporation patterns suggested that phenolic hydroxyls, but not glycosidic bonds of melanoidin-bound phenolics are cleaved during thermal processing. Antioxidant capacity of bread melanoidins increased due to enrichment with guava flour and increasing baking periods and was partially attributed to bound phenolics.

The antioxidant activity was investigated using the 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The antigenotoxic potential was determined via the comet assay. The ethyl acetate fraction (EtOAc) was analysed by LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS: phenolic acids and flavonoids were the main polyphenols of the fruits. The EtOAc fraction yielded the highest content of polyphenols with 314.61 mg GAE/g extract, followed by 297.51, 153.75, 101.47, 97.19 for dichloromethane, butanol, methanol and water extracts, respectively. As expected, a strong correlation exists between the antioxidant activity of the investigated extracts and their total phenolic content. In the DPPH assay, the IC<sub>50</sub> value of the most active EtOAc fraction was 6.79 μg/ml, relative to 2.92 μg/ml of the standard ascorbic acid. ABTS and FRAP assays supported the results of DPPH assay. Moreover, using the comet assay, we could show that the phenol-rich EtOAc extract exhibits an antigenotoxic potential in human liver cancer cells (Hep-G2) treated with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) as a genotoxic agent.

Sweet potato pectin dispersions (0.0025, 0.005 and 0.01g/mL) in deionized water were sonolyzed for 5, 10 and 20min to assess effect of sonication time and pectin concentration on sonolysis. For further experiments 0.0025g/mL was sonicated under varying ultrasonic power and duty cycle levels, subsequently the molecular weight, galacturonic acid content, degree of methoxylation and antioxidant activity of sonicated pectin products were investigated. Results showed that ultrasound treatment reduced pectin molecular weight, while polydispersity did not show clear trend which characterized random pectin scission, increasing duty cycle from 20% to 80% resulted in approximately threefold reduction in pectin molecular weight, increased sonication power from 100W to 400W led to significant increase in galacturonic acid content from 72.0±1.2% in native pectin to between 85.0±3.2% and 92.0±2.7%, the degree of methoxylation significantly reduced from 12.0±3.0% to between 5.25% and 6.28%, sonication led to increase in galactose and decrease in rhamnose consistent with debranching of pectin. Moreover, sonication lead to increased antioxidant capacity, both 200W and 400W sonicated pectin having higher ORAC and FRAP values, with highest pectin concentration 4mg/mL in ORAC and 0.8mg/ml in FRAP giving substantially high antioxidant activity than native and 100W treated pectin. The ORAC value of 400W sonicated pectin increased five hold above the native pectin, while it's FRAP value was almost three fold higher than native pectin. However, ultrasound did not alter pectin primary structure as showed by FTIR and HPAEC results.

The extract was obtained using 80% ethanol and evaluated in terms of total phenolic content, reducing power based on the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) reagent, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. The patties were made with ground thigh fillets, chicken skin, and 2% salt. They were homogenized and divided into the following two groups: a control treatment without antioxidants and a peanut skin treatment with 70 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/kg per patty. Analyses of the fatty acid profiles, instrumental colors (L*, a*, and b*) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were performed on d 1, 8, and 15 of storage at 1±1ºC. The peanut skin extract resulted in a phenolic content of 32.6±0.7 mg GAE/g dry skin, an antioxidant activity (FRAP) of 26.5±0.8 6 μmol Trolox equivalent/g dry skin, and an efficient concentration (EC50) of 46.5 μg/mL. The total unsaturated fatty acid was approximately 73%, and 39% of this fatty acid content was monounsaturated. The peanut skin extract slowed the decrease in the a* values (P<0.05) but reduced the L* and b* values compared to the control samples during storage (P<0.05). Lipid oxidation was minimized by the peanut skin extract (P<0.05), which resulted in a maximum value of 0.97 malondialdehyde (MDA)/kg compared to values that were close 19 mg MDA/kg patties in the control sample at the end of storage period. Thus, it can be concluded that although peanut skin extract causes little color change, it can be applied as a natural antioxidant to cooked chicken patties because it efficiently inhibits lipid oxidation in this product during refrigerated storage.",,,0.7,mg/g,"""salt"" AND FRAP AND antioxidant"

In Vitro Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) Assay.,"In the present study, the seasonal variability of the in vitro ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), total phenols, and terpene hydrocarbon content in 70% ethanol extracts were evaluated. The samples of crushed (CBs) and non-crushed ripe juniper berries (NCBs) collected at five localities in North-East Slovakia during the years 2012-2014 were compared. The method of preparation of the extract influenced the amount of dry matter (DM) in the extracts. In the CB extracts were statistically higher contents of DM (from 13.91 ± 0.11 g·L<sup>-1</sup> to 23.84 ± 0.14 g·L<sup>-1</sup>) compared to NCB extracts (from 1.39 ± 0.01 g·L<sup>-1</sup> to 16.55 ± 0.09 g·L<sup>-1</sup>). The differences in antioxidant activity between the investigated localities were statistically significant for both types of extract. For example, in 2013 in the locality of Zbojné, the FRAP in NCBs was 76.62 µmol·L<sup>-1</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup> DM and in CBs was 138.27 µmol·L<sup>-1</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup> DM, while in the Miľpoš locality, in NCBs there was 232.66 µmol·L<sup>-1</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup> DM and in CBs there was 1178.98 µmol·L<sup>-1</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup> DM. The differences in the antioxidant activity between the studied years in the case of NCB extracts were not statistically significant. In the case of CB extracts, significant differences between the evaluated years were found. Statistics by ANOVA confirmed that CB extracts prepared from berries in the year 2013 showed significantly higher activity compared to CB extracts from berries from the years 2012 and 2014. Based on the Pearson we found a negative correlation coefficient between the FRAP assay and the content of total polyphenols in NCB extracts (-0.531 in 2012; -0.349 in 2013; and -0.224 in 2014).

Besides the podophyllotoxin, phenolic substances play a key role in the clinical practice. However, few reports were available in terms of the phenolic compositions and antioxidant activity. In this work, main phenolic compounds were quantified by RP-HPLC in seven organs from <i>S. hexandrum</i>. Simultaneously, the sodium borohydride/chloranil-based (SBC) method and the Folin-Ciocalteau colorimetric method were used to determine total flavonoids and total phenols contents, respectively. The antioxidant activity of the different organs was further assessed by three methods (DPPH method, ABTS method and FRAP method). Phenolic compositions/total flavonoids contents/total phenols contents/antioxidant activity was observed to have significant differences among different organs (<i>P</i><0.05), but have a consistent changing rule viz. rhizome>root>fruit>flower>leaf>stem>petiole. Furthermore, a correlation analysis was employed and indicated that a positive correlation existed between phenolic compositions contents and antioxidant activity.

Its antioxidant properties and inhibitory effects on enzyme-carbohydrate digestion activities have been demonstrated. The present study aimed to provide data that can contribute to rationalizing the preparation of antioxidant and antidiabetic extracts from this plant. <i>P. capitata</i> (whole plant) growing on <i>Persea americana</i> was harvested at the fruiting stage. A response surface design-type central composite was applied to maximize the extraction yield, phenolic contents, and antioxidant and antidiabetic properties of the ethyl acetate extract of <i>P. capitata</i>. The influencing extraction factors were temperature, powder particle size, and solvent-to-powder ratio. The total phenolic content, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), DPPH scavenging ability, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and antidiabetic (<i>α</i>-amylase and <i>α</i>-glucosidase inhibitory) effects of the extracts were determined using conventional methods. A temperature above 55°C contributed to the degradation of the extract, which was reflected in the GC-MS profile by a significant reduction in the number of compounds it contained. The optimal conditions were defined as 24.42°C for temperature, 250 <i>µ</i>m powder particle size, and 8.30 (v:w) solvent-to-powder ratio. This extraction protocol resulted in more than twice the extraction yield (3.05%), TTC (62.30 mg TAE/g), TAC (41.41 mg AAE/g), FRAP (186.56 mg AAE/g), and <i>α</i>-amylase (IC<sub>50</sub> 15.05 <i>µ</i>g/mL) and <i>α</i>-glucosidase (IC<sub>50</sub> 21.14 <i>µ</i>g/mL) inhibitory activities compared to our previous results. Additionally, these optimal conditions led experimentally to the extraction of higher phenolic content and to the attainment of higher antioxidant and antidiabetic activity, which closely matched the predicted values. Using these conditions, it is possible to prepare an antidiabetic phytomedicine from P. capitatathat can prevent oxidative stress complications.

The higher antioxidant activities were found in HD EO (IC50 of 16.25 ± 0.09 mg/mL from DPPH assay and 0.91 ± 0.01 mg TEAC/g extract from FRAP assay). The survival of normal fibroblast cell lines remained at 90% at 500 µg/mL HD EO, where the EO possessed the half-maximal toxicity dose (TD50) of 214.85 ± 4.647 and 241.128 ± 2.134 μg/mL on B16F10 and A375 cell lines, respectively. This could suggest that the EO is highly selective against the melanoma cell lines. The melanin content was decreased at the half-maximum efficacy (IC50) at 252.12 ± 3.02 and 253.56 ± 3.65 in the A375 and B1610 cell lines, respectively, which were approximately 2.8-fold lower than kojic acid, the standard compound.

High photosynthesis rate (10.05 μmol CO(2) m(-2)s(-1) in Halia Bara) and plant biomass (83.4 g in Halia Bentong) were observed at 800 μmol mol(-1) CO(2). Stomatal conductance decreased and water use efficiency increased with elevated CO(2) concentration. Total flavonoids (TF), total phenolics (TP), total soluble carbohydrates (TSC), starch and plant biomass increased significantly (P ≤ 0.05) in all parts of the ginger varieties under elevated CO(2) (800 μmol mol(-1)). The order of the TF and TP increment in the parts of the plant was rhizomes > stems > leaves. More specifically, Halia Bara had a greater increase of TF (2.05 mg/g dry weight) and TP (14.31 mg/g dry weight) compared to Halia Bentong (TF: 1.42 mg/g dry weight; TP: 9.11 mg/g dry weight) in average over the whole plant. Furthermore, plants with the highest rate of photosynthesis had the highest TSC and phenolics content. Significant differences between treatments and species were observed for TF and TP production. Correlation coefficient showed that TSC and TP content are positively correlated in both varieties. The antioxidant activity, as determined by the ferric reducing/antioxidant potential (FRAP) activity, increased in young ginger grown under elevated CO(2). The FRAP values for the leaves, rhizomes and stems extracts of both varieties grown under two different CO(2) concentrations (400 and 800 μmol mol(-1)) were significantly lower than those of vitamin C (3107.28 μmol Fe (II)/g) and α-tocopherol (953 μmol Fe (II)/g), but higher than that of BHT (74.31 μmol Fe (II)/g).

This study investigated the antioxidant properties of the leaves of Curcuma longa L. against the oxidation of soybean oil using leaf extracts obtained from seven different types of organic solvents and compared to the action of efficient synthetic antioxidants which are widely used and low cost but with toxicity risk. The application of natural alternatives from sources still little studied is a proposal and the extraction of compounds with high antioxidant capacity may vary according to the type of solvent, its mixture, its polarity and other factors that burden or harm the health of the consumer. The leaf extracts were sanitized, dried, and obtained for solvent selection. The quantification of total phenolic compounds (TPC) and antioxidants was performed by using different combinations and proportions of solvents: water (100%), ethanol (100%), methanol (100%), ethanol/water (70%:30%), methanol/water (70%:30%), methanol/acetic acid (99.5%:0.5%), and acetone/water/acetic acid (70%:28:2%). The solvent selected was the one that extracted the highest content of phenolic and antioxidant compounds (using the free radical DPPH scavenging method and FRAP assay). It used an accelerated storage test and experimental design to assess oxidative stability (using peroxide index (PI), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), dienes (DC) and triple conjugates (TC) and statistical analysis). The ethanol/water solvent was efficient in the extraction of TPC (2422 mg GAE 100 g-1). The mixture of solvents extracted an average of 23.65% more TPC when compared to the single solvents. Regarding the antioxidant capacity, the ethanol/water solvent showed 1847 mg TE 100 g-1 using the DPPH and 217 μmol of FeSO4 100 g-1 using the FRAP assays. In addition, the oxidation of soybean oil was delayed by the accelerated storage test showing equivalent results to BHT at 0.02% for the values of PI, TBARS and DC/TC. The E/W extract showed the highest yield in the extraction of phenolic compounds and is a safe solvent for food. The addition of Curcuma longa L. leaf extract to soybean oil caused reductions in PI, TBARS, CD and CT values.

Medicinal plants with the therapeutic value have potential to produce honey with greater bioactivity. The aim of the present study was to characterize the physico-chemical and antioxidant capacities of <i>Agastache</i> honey produced from <i>Agastache rugosa</i> and compare them with other popular commercial honeys sold in Australia. The total phenolics, total flavonoids, moisture content, colour, pH, protein content and antioxidant capacity were evaluated for <i>Agastache</i>, Manuka, Jelly bush, Tea tree, Super manuka and Jarrah honeys. The results reveal that the moisture content ranged from 17-21%, pH ranged from 3.8-4.3 and estimated protein content ranged from 900-2200 µg/g. The DPPH•, ABTS•+, ORAC and FRAP methods were used to measure the antioxidant capacity of the honey samples. The DPPH• % inhibition, ABTS•+, ORAC and FRAP values for <i>Agastache</i> honey were 9.85 (±1.98 µmol TE/g), 26.88 (±0.32 µmol TE/g), 19.78 (±1.1 µmol TE/g) and 3.61 (±0.02 µmol TE/g) whereas the highest antioxidant capacity values obtained were 18.69 (±0.9 µmol TE/g), 30.72 (±0.27 µmol TE/g), 26.95 (±0.9 µmol TE/g) and 3.68 (±0.04 µmol TE/g), respectively. There was a positive correlation between colour, total phenolic content and DPPH• scavenging activity for most of the honeys except Tea tree honey. However, there was no clear correlation with ABTS•+, ORAC and FRAP values. The measured antioxidant capacity of samples varied with the assays used. The DPPH• assay clearly indicated that the phenolic compounds contribute to the scavenging activity of the honeys. Nevertheless, all assays confirm that <i>Agastache</i> honey has significant antioxidant capacity. Therefore, <i>Agastache</i> honey can be important to human nutrition and health.",,,1.98,µmol te/g,"""tea"" AND FRAP AND antioxidant"

The antioxidant activity of the extract was assessed by ABTS and FRAP assays and the total phenolic compounds was measured at different pH levels. Identification and quantification of chlorogenic acid isomers were carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Intestinal microbiota modulation was evaluated by administering the yerba-mate extract or water (control) to Wistar rats via intragastric gavage and its efficiency was measured through PCR. The antioxidant capacity of the yerba-mate extract was 64.53 ± 0.26 μmol Trolox/mL (ABTS) and 52.96 ± 0.86 μmol Trolox/mL (FRAP). The total phenolic compounds showed higher levels at pH 7.5 compared to pH 2.0. Chlorogenic acid isomers were found in greater abundance, with a concentration of 14.22 g/100 g. The administration of the extract resulted in positive modulation of the intestinal microbiota, specifically for the genera Lactobacillus sp. and Prevotella sp. The increase of these genera is related to the promotion of homeostasis of the gut microbiota. Therefore, these findings indicate that yerba-mate extract possesses significant antioxidant activity and can effectively modulate the intestinal microbiota in rats.

A previous study by our research group demonstrated that <i>P. malayana</i> methanolic and water extract exhibits significant potential as an effective agent for managing diabetes. Further research has been performed on the extraction optimization of this plant to enhance its inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase, a key enzyme associated with diabetes, and to reduce its toxicity. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties of the optimized <i>P. malayana</i> leaf extract (OE), to evaluate its toxicity using a zebrafish embryo/larvae model, and to analyze its metabolites. The anti-diabetic effects were assessed by investigating α-glucosidase inhibition (AGI), while the inflammation inhibitory activity was performed using the soybean lipoxygenase inhibitory (SLOXI) test. The assessment of antioxidant activity was performed utilizing FRAP and DPPH assays. The toxicology study was conducted using the zebrafish embryo/larvae (<i>Danio rerio</i>) model. The metabolites present in the extracts were analyzed using GC-MS and LC-MS. OE demonstrated significant AGI and SLOXI activities, represented as 2.02 and 4.92 µg/mL for IC<sub>50</sub> values, respectively. It exhibited potent antioxidant activities as determined by IC<sub>50</sub> values of 13.08 µg/mL (using the DPPH assay) and 95.44 mmol TE/mg DW (using the FRAP assay), and also demonstrated an LC<sub>50</sub> value of 224.29 µg/mL, which surpasses its therapeutic index of 111.03. OE exhibited a higher therapeutic index compared to that of the methanol extract (13.84) stated in the previous state of the art. This suggests that OE exhibits a lower level of toxicity, making it safer for use, and has the potential to be highly effective in its anti-diabetic activity. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) demonstrated the presence of several constituents in this extract. Among them, several compounds, such as propanoic acid, succinic acid, D-tagatose, myo-inositol, isorhamnetin, moracin M-3'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, procyanidin B3, and leucopelargonidin, have been reported as possessing anti-diabetic and antioxidant activities.

In previous work, <i>Moringa oleifera</i> leaf peptides (MOPHs) with antioxidant potential were generated and identified. However, the spectrophotometric methods used to evaluate their antioxidant activity do not fully reflect its potential. In this work, the antioxidant activity of MOPHs was assessed by the ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP) and cellular antioxidant activity method on the human colon cancer cell line Caco-2. Also, their antiproliferative activity was evaluated. The MOPHs exhibited a FRAP activity of 1435 µmol TE/g, and at 500 µg/mL; the peptides did not show a cytotoxic effect on healthy colon CCD-18Co cells.

Citrus pomace was characterized chemically, and seven DESs were formulated for extraction. Two groups of extractions were performed. Group 1 extractions were performed only with DESs, at 40 °C and 60 °C, with CPWP (Citrus pomace with pectin) and CPNP (Citrus pomace no pectin). In group 2, the DES was associated with pectinlyase and used only with CPWP at 60 °C in two ways of extraction: E1S (one-step extraction) and E2E (2-step extraction). The extracts were evaluated TPC (total phenolic compounds), individual phenolic compounds by HPLC, and antioxidant capacity by methodologies of DPPH and FRAP. The results of group 1 extractions for CPWP showed the highest phenolic compounds concentration (559.2 ± 2.79 mg/100 g DM) at 60 °C.

Encapsulation is a sound technology to provide thermal stability and controlled release attributes to functional compounds such as plant seed oil. Nano-sized and micro-sized capsules harboring MSO were generated by utilizing thin film dispersion, spray drying, and lyophilization strategies. Fourier infrared transform analysis (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and particle size analyses were used for the authentication and morphological characterization of the samples. Spray drying and lyophilization effectuated the formation of microscale capsules (2660 ± 14 nm, 3140 ± 12 nm, respectively), while liposomal encapsulation brought about the development of nano-capsules (282.30 ± 2.35 nm). Nano-liposomal systems displayed significant thermal stability compared to microcapsules. According to in vitro release studies, microcapsules started to release MSO in simulated salivary fluid (SSF) and this continued in gastric (SGF) and intestinal (SIF) environments. There was no oil release for nano-liposomes in SSF, while limited release was observed in SGF and the highest release was observed in SIF.

In this work, the predominant compound of this class, 5-CQA, was extracted by Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction (UAE) under conditions optimized by an Experimental Design. The investigated variables solid/solvent ratio (1:10-1:50 g/mL), water content in ethanol (30-100% <i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) and UAE time (5-20 min) highlighted a critical influence of the last two factors on the extraction efficiency: extracts richer in 5-CQA were obtained with lower water content (30%) and time (5 min). The addition of ascorbic acid (1.7 mM) as anti-browning agent to the extraction solvent improved the extraction efficiency of 5-CQA compared to acetic and citric acids (3158.71 μg/mL, 1766.71 μg/mL, 1468.20 μg/mL, respectively). A parallel trend for the three acids and an increase in 5-CQA recovery was obtained with the use of freeze-dried sprouts (4980.05 μg/mL, 4795.62, 4211.25 μg/mL, respectively). Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in vitro demonstrated UAE being a more valuable technique than conventional maceration.

An HPLC-DAD method was applied to monitor 5-CQA recovery, while an LC-HRMS/MS investigation allowed us to perform analyte identity confirmation along with detection of the glycoalkaloids α-solanine and α-chaconine. This evidence underlines the necessity to develop purification strategies in order to maximize the potential of potato sprout waste as a source of 5-CQA.",by-product,potato,24.01,mg te/g,"""potato"" AND FRAP AND antioxidant"
